CS203 Project Lab Assignment 5
1.Idea - Voting Machine for Student Council Elections
In this project, we are going to make an electronic voting machine by using various gates and controls. The language which we are going to use for this project is Verilog. The Electronic Voting Machine responds on some flow of pulses coming from the switch operated by voter and produces the output of the counting values i.e. total casting votes of individual nominee and displays it. These systems are designed with sophisticated electronic elecments and devices such as microcontroller, comparator, complexed multiplexer, memory etc. Our idea is to make a similar EVM but in a simpler way to make it easily accessible at a much lower cost.
The machine will have two modes - Voting mode and Result mode. In voting mode we can give vote to each candidate and when we switch the mode and select one candidate it will display the number of votes received by that contestant and in this way we can determine the result in a very fair manner. We will set the number of candidates who are going to contest and then the machine can be used. After the counting of votes, we will use the reset to erase all the existing data i.e., the number of votes each candidate got. Thus, we can use this Electronic Voting Machine in day to day life for simple elections in various fields and departments.
